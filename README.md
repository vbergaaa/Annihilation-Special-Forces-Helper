# Annihilation-Special-Forces-Helper

You can use this program to plan how to spend your perks and save multiple loadouts.
It supports full cost calculations for all the perks in the game.

### Current feature roadmap:
1. Adding stat calculations so you can determine which perks you will benefit from the most
2. Adding support for gems
3. Adding support for souls, including saving souls and attaching them to a loadout
4. CP support

### Potiential future features
- Adding a helper that suggests different perks to increase stats with best stats/cost ratio
- Same as above but for economics
- Profile page, including name, rank, current RP, mod score, soul collection, etc.
- Adding a "I played a game" option, to better track what your current RP is in realtime.
- Incorporating unit stats and costs into the helper

## About
This is a program used to assist players who play the SC2 Custom Arcade Game, "Annihilation Special Forces" created by <Cruxis>jessy. 
It is compatible with Windows 10.

You can use this program to plan and create your in game loadouts, limiting them to your available perk points, gems, souls and challenge points. 
  
It estimates the statistics for your loadout, providing:
  - Player statistics, going beyond the in-game stats by including stats for unit specific buffs, such as infusions, essence, and rank.
  - Unit statistics, to give estimations of a particular units attack, armor, health, etc. at any infusion or rank for the current loadout.
  - A Damage and Toughness score, which approximates you units strength considering the current difficulty, and the typical unit composition for that difficulty.

It also contains economy data, such as:
  - Unit cost information for any unit in the game, configured to your current perks and souls. This allows you to compare perks to see the effect on the cost of a particular unit, and allows you to compare costs of different units at different infuses and ranks.
  - Income data, for any room on any difficulty, configured to your current perks and souls.

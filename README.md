# Annihilation-Special-Forces-Helper
This is a program used to assist players who play the SC2 Custom Arcade Game, "Annihilation Special Forces" created by <Cruxis>jessy

You can use this program to plan and create your in game loadouts, limiting them to your available perk points, gems, souls and challenge points. It shows you your player statistics, going beyond the in-game stats by including stats for unit specific buffs, such as infusions, essence, and rank.

It also contains data for unit statistics for most units in the game, allowing you to compare statistics of different units with any perks, rank, upgrades, etc.

# Annihilation-Special-Forces-Helper
A program used to assist players who play the SC2 Custom Arcade Game, "Annihilation Special Forces" created by Jessy

You can use this program to plan and create your in game loadouts. It accurately shows your player statistics, going beyond the in-game stats by including unit specific buffs from things like perks, souls, and ranks.

It also shows you unit statistics for any unit in the game, allowing you to compare statistics of different units with any upgrades.

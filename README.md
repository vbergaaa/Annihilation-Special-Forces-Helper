# Annihilation-Special-Forces-Helper
A program used to assist players who play the SC2 Custom Arcade Game, "Annihilation Special Forces"

You can use this program to plan and create your in game loadouts. It accurately shows your complete statistics, and goes beyond the in-game stats by including unit specific buffs from perks, souls, and ranks, as well as combining them to give you an indication of your overall power.

## Download Instructions
To run this program, you will need to have Microsoft .NET Core installed on you computer. To check if your computer already has it installed, you can run the following command from a command prompt window:
`dotnet --version`

If the version number is less than 3, or the command 'dotnet' could not be found, you will need to install .Net Core Runtime from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime)

Once you have dotnet installed, download <b>ASF.zip</b> from the newest release page, found [here](https://github.com/vbergaaa/Annihilation-Special-Forces-Helper/releases).

Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract the files and run ASFLauncher.exe.

If you have already downloaded a previous version of this application, you will need copy the "Loadouts" and "Souls" folders from the old application directory to the new application directory to retain your previous data.

### Feature roadmap:
1. Add individual units to the program to get even more accurate stats.
2. Adding an economy calculator to help you determine which eco perks will give you the most value.

### Potiential future features
- Adding support for in game upgrades, to more extensively track costs and stats of specific units.
- Adding a helper that suggests different perks or gems to increase stats with best stats/cost ratio.
- Add RP tracking functionality

#### Developer's Note
Development for this program has slowed due to lack of community interest. However, I am still open to feature requests and will fix bugs, so feel free to raise an issue on [this page](https://github.com/vbergaaa/Annihilation-Special-Forces-Helper/issues).

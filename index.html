        <p>You can use this program to plan and create your in game loadouts, limiting them to your available perk points, gems, souls and challenge points.</p>

        <p>It estimates the statistics for your loadout, providing:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Player statistics, going beyond the in-game stats by including stats for unit specific buffs, such as infusions, essence, and rank.</li>
            <li>Unit statistics, to give estimations of a particular units attack, armor, health, etc. at any infusion or rank for the current loadout.</li>
            <li>A Damage and Toughness score, which approximates you units strength considering the current difficulty, and the typical unit composition for that difficulty.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It also contains economy data, such as:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Unit cost information for any unit in the game, configured to your current perks and souls. This allows you to compare perks to see the effect on the cost of a particular unit, and allows you to compare costs of different units at different infuses and ranks.</li>
            <li>Income data, for any room on any difficulty, configured to your current perks and souls.</li>
        </ul>
